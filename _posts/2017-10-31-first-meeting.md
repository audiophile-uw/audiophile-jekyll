I'll be going over the main plans for the group, what its visions are, all that jazz.

Since it's going to be more than 2 hours long and I don't think I'll go over the club's plan for more than one hour. We'll play some music as well. Thomson 335 does not have a good speaker system, I'll try to find a better room or bring equipment soon.

Beverage and snacks will be provided. Bring your friends! See you there!
